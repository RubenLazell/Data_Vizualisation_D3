Coursework #2
In this assessment you will take on the role of a Data Scientist who has been assigned to a project
that aims to analyse weather data for marketing purposes. In particular, you have been asked to
create an interactive visualisation dashboard that will allow you and your colleagues to explore this
dataset and discover patterns.
In this second coursework, you will focus on creating the final visualisation dashboard, building
upon, and extending the work from the first coursework.
This document describes the tasks to undertake in detail, along with requirements for the
submission of the coursework, marking criteria, and finally, the data you are given to visualise.
Please make sure to read it thoroughly, as failure to do so might see you losing marks.
Tasks
For this coursework, your first task is to set a general question about the dataset that your dashboard
will help to answer. This can be supported by your initial exploration of the dataset made in the first
coursework.
This coursework will involve three activities (your tasks):
1. Development
2. Design Report
3. Presentation
Development
First you should design and develop the visualisation dashboard. It can have as many charts as you
see fit, but you are required to implement visualisations for two of the following types of data:
temporal, geographical and hierarchical. The code and visualisation developed during the module’s
Practical Lab sessions should be your starting point, however, you are strongly invited to enhance
these and/or implement new visualisations. Your choice of visualisation must be appropriate for the
type of data presented.
Your dashboard must be interactive. The visualisation should implement cross-highlight and crossselection interaction, meaning that it should be possible to interact with one visualisation to
highlight elements or refine the data subset in another. You will have to decide which subsets of the
dataset to represent. Your code must implement dynamic data operations to aggregate and/or filter
the provided dataset and respond to user inputs.
With your visualisation and interaction design choices, you must also create and implement a
dashboard design that serves your initial question about the dataset. The layout must fit in one fullscreen browser window (~ 1900×900 pixels maximum). General UI and UX principles should be
applied, and the layout should serve the interaction design.
The code submitted is expected to be ready to run in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. No thirdparty library other than the ones provided should be used.
If part of your implementation is supported or inspired by external resources (e.g., online forums,
documentation, tutorials) you should cite those in comments.

Design Report
Your second task will be to produce a report explaining your design decisions in the development
of this dashboard. This should include the following parts:
1. The question you have set for the analysis of the dataset and motivation for the dashboard
design.
2. The justification for your choice of visualisations.
3. The justification for your choice of interactions.
4. The justification for your choice of dashboard layout.
Your report must be maximum 5 A4 pages in length.
