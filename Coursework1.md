Coursework #1
In this assessment you will take on the role of a Data Scientist who has been assigned to a project
that aims to analyse weather data for marketing purposes. In particular, you have been asked to
create an interactive visualisation dashboard that will allow you and your colleagues to explore this
dataset and discover patterns.
In this first coursework, you will focus on creating an initial dashboard prototype to explore the
dataset. In the second coursework you will further develop and finalise your visualisation
dashboard.
This document describes the tasks to undertake in detail, along with requirements for the
submission of the coursework, marking criteria, and finally, the data you are given to visualise.
Please make sure to read it thoroughly, as failure to do so might see you losing marks.
Tasks
This coursework will involve two activities (your tasks):
1. Development
2. Presentation
Development
Your first task will be to develop the visualisation dashboard prototype. It can have as many charts
as you see fit, but at minimum, you are required to implement three different types of charts. The
code and visualisation developed during the moduleâ€™s Practical Lab sessions should be your starting
point, however, you are strongly invited to enhance these and/or implement new visualisations.
Your choice of visualisation must be appropriate for the type of data presented. You will have to
decide which subsets of the dataset you wish to see visualised. Your code must implement data
operations to aggregate and/or filter the provided dataset. Your dashboard must be interactive. The
visualisations should implement basic linked- highlight interaction, meaning that it should be
possible to interact with one visualisation to highlight elements on another.
If part of your implementation is supported or inspired by external resources (e.g., online forums,
documentation, tutorials) you should cite those in comments. The code submitted is expected to be
ready to run in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. No third-party library other than the ones
provided should be used
